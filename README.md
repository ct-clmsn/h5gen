## NAME

h5gen - generate HDF5 files from Data Description Language (DDL) files

## SYNOPSIS

    h5gen -o output.h5 input.ddl
    h5gen input.ddl         # take name of output file from DDL itself
    some_source | h5gen     # read DDL text from stdin

## DESCRIPTION

`h5gen` takes as input text written in
[Data Description Language (DDL)](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ddl.html)
syntax, and generates
[Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5)](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5)
files from it. In a sense, it is the reverse operation of `h5dump`, a tool
bundled with the HDF5 distribution that takes HDF5 files and converts them to
DDL.

## WARNING

This software is beta quality and comes without any warranty (see the license
for the full details). It was written to solve a particular problem, and may not
be suitable for your purpose(s).

**Do not use this tool in production.** In particular, this tool

  * is unfinished
  * relies on an informal specification that may change without prior notice
  * has not been tested exhaustively (there are tests, but they are not
    waterproof; the external utilities used for comparing may fail to detect
    differences)
  * is not designed for high performance

## COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS

  * `-o output.h5`

    **Optional.** Specify the name of the output HDF5 file (usually ends in
    `.h5`, but it need not). By default, the name inside the DDL text is used
    (the text string that follows the `HDF5` keyword).

  * `input.ddl`

    **Optional.** Specify the name of the input file containing DDL text. By
    default, `h5gen` reads from `stdin`.

## MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND

I wrote this tool because I needed small HDF5 files as test input files in
another project. At the time, there didn't seem to be a quick and easy way to
generate HDF5 files without using the C/C++/Fortran/... API; in short, without
writing a program. But the syntax of DDL is so simple to understand and write,
that the idea of writing a parser for DDL seemed very appealing. So I wrote
one.

It's perhaps necessary to say what this tool __is not__. I wrote this tool only
to solve my immediate problem. Many features are lacking, many valid DDL
constructs are not recognized, and it is entirely possible there are serious
problems I have not yet discovered. It is not a general or recommended means of
generating HDF5. You should really use the C (or C++/Fortran/Java/...) API for
that. Those interfaces are likely much better tested, and much more performant.
This tool is not meant to be a DDL validator; it may accepts constructs that do
not represent the DDL that would be generated by `h5dump`. Also, please note
that the DDL specification is by no means official; it is informative at best,
and may change at any time without prior notice. As far as I know, there are no
regression tests for the output of the `h5dump` tool (the principal producer of
DDL), so `h5gen` may break at any future update of the HDF5 library.

That said, if you need a tool to quickly hack together HDF5 files for testing
(as I did), here it is. If you want to know which features are supported, or if
you want to understand how much you can trust this tool, have a look at the
tests (the test data files reside in `ddl/` and `h5/`).

## HOMEPAGE

`h5gen` can be found at <https://github.com/ebaudrez/h5gen>.

## QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    ./configure --with-hdf5=DIR
    make
    make check              # perform the self-tests; recommended
    make install

`h5gen` is managed using [Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf) and
[Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake). Installation is fairly
straightforward. The options of `configure` are standard, with one
package-specific option of note:

  * `--with-hdf5=DIR`

    Specifies the path where the HDF5 library is to be found (executables,
    include files, library). By default, looks into your system's default
    paths.

I recommend you run the self-tests by issuing `make check` after compilation.
Even though they take a while to run, they may alert you of possible problems
(e.g., when you are using another version of the HDF5 library than the one I
have tested against). Any self-test failure should be considered a bug.

## BUGS

None known. Feedback and bug reports welcome.
